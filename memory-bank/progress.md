# Progress

## Backoffice business logic integration (2026-08-05)

Scope changed:
1. `scripts/src/sample-usage.ts`
2. `uis/backoffice/app/page.tsx`
3. `uis/backoffice/app/globals.css`
4. `uis/backoffice/app/layout.tsx`
5. `uis/backoffice/next.config.ts`

What changed:
1. Replaced the default Next.js starter route at `uis/backoffice/` with a dedicated Nexova talent operations dashboard.
2. Imported the existing sample data and calculated results directly from `scripts/src/sample-usage.ts`; no business logic was copied into the UI.
3. Rendered visible business-logic output for vacancy details, candidate ranking, validation status, average salary, vacancy fill rate, seniority distribution, top skills, status counts, and normalized email search.
4. Removed the import-time `console.log` from `scripts/src/sample-usage.ts` so it can be safely consumed by the Next.js application.
5. Configured Turbopack to use the monorepo root and allow the backoffice to bundle the original shared `scripts` directory.
6. Made the backoffice navigation persist during scrolling with a viewport-sticky desktop sidebar and sticky mobile top navigation.

Validation performed:
1. `npm run lint` inside `uis/backoffice` (passed).
2. `npm run build` inside `uis/backoffice` (passed; static `/` route generated).
3. Manual runtime verification at `http://localhost:3000/` (passed; dashboard rendered shared script results).
4. Browser scroll verification (passed; sidebar retained `position: sticky` at the viewport edge while viewing the reports section).

Remaining risks / notes:
1. The dashboard currently uses the repository sample data and has no API, authentication, or CRUD integration.

## Website migration update (2026-08-03)

Scope changed:
1. `uis/website/app/page.tsx`
2. `uis/website/app/globals.css`
3. `uis/website/app/layout.tsx`
4. `uis/website/app/application/page.tsx`
5. `uis/website/public/assets/*` (copied from `uis/landing_page/assets/*`)

What changed:
1. Replaced default Next starter home with a Nexova landing page recreation that mirrors the static `uis/landing_page/index.html` structure:
   - sticky header and anchor navigation
   - hero section with CTA
   - services cards (3 columns)
   - why-Nexova section
   - contact section and branded footer
2. Ported interaction and animation behavior to Next styles:
   - hero background pan
   - CTA pulse and hover transitions
   - service-card hover lift/zoom
   - reveal-on-scroll with IntersectionObserver
   - reduced-motion accessibility fallback
3. Added Organization JSON-LD markup on the Next home page.
4. Updated site metadata in the Next layout to reflect Nexova SEO context.
5. Fully migrated `uis/landing_page/application.html` + `validation.js` behavior to Next route `uis/website/app/application/page.tsx`:
   - complete form fields
   - all required validation rules and exact error messages
   - live validation events (input/blur/change)
   - comments remaining counter with over-limit warning
   - policy checkbox enforcement
   - success modal with close/backdrop/escape behavior
   - reset handling and scroll-to-top on successful simulated submit

Validation performed:
1. `npm run lint` inside `uis/website` (passed).
2. `npm run build` inside `uis/website` (passed, static routes `/` and `/application` generated).

Remaining risks / notes:
1. Form submission is currently simulated client-side (no API integration), matching the original static milestone behavior.

## Audit summary (2026-08-03)

Audited folders:
1. `uis/landing_page`
2. `scripts`
3. `uis/talent-pipeline-tracker`

## Current status by area

### `uis/landing_page`

Status: Functional for milestone-style static delivery.

Completed:
1. Company-aligned landing structure with required sections and CTA.
2. Separate application page with required candidate intake fields.
3. Client-side validation for key constraints and expected messages.
4. Company-service redirection message for non-candidate inquiries.
5. Organization schema markup included.

Gaps and risks:
1. No automated test coverage for validation logic.
2. Tailwind CDN approach is simple but not optimized for production bundling.
3. Language mode is currently single-language (English), while bilingual support is recommended.

### `scripts`

Status: Core TypeScript logic implemented and organized.

Completed:
1. Domain models for candidate, vacancy, and process entities.
2. Filtering, sorting, and searching utilities.
3. Candidate scoring, ranking, grouping, and reporting functions.
4. Validation utilities for candidate and vacancy constraints.
5. Sample usage file that exercises main utilities.

Gaps and risks:
1. No formal automated tests were found.
2. README is generic and does not yet document concrete script execution workflows.
3. No dedicated scripts package configuration was identified in this folder.

### `uis/talent-pipeline-tracker`

Status: Major milestone requirements are implemented.

Completed:
1. Candidate list route with async fetch, loading/error states, filters, search, and pagination behavior.
2. Candidate detail route with full field display plus status/stage updates.
3. Notes workflow: list, add, and delete.
4. Candidate create route and candidate edit route.
5. API abstraction layer and TypeScript types for payloads and records.

Gaps and risks:
1. No automated test suite found for pages, components, or API integration.
2. Workspace currently includes `.next/` and `node_modules/` inside this app path; this can hide real diffs and slow audits.
3. Environment setup depends on `PROJECT_API_URL`; missing variable causes runtime failure by design.

## Recommended next steps

1. Replace root `CONTEXT.md` placeholder with the canonical company context to reduce ambiguity across folders.
2. Add minimal automated coverage:
   - unit tests for `scripts/src/utils/*`
   - integration/UI tests for tracker critical flows
   - validation tests for landing form rules.
3. Add lightweight runbooks to each audited folder describing install/run/test commands and expected env vars.
4. Ensure build artifacts and dependency directories are excluded from version-control workflows and audit scopes.
5. Create a short acceptance checklist that maps each milestone requirement to concrete file evidence for faster final review.

## Governance setup completed (2026-08-03)

1. Added root agent contract at `AGENTS.md` with required memory-bank read order, mandatory pre-commit workflow, and protected paths requiring explicit confirmation.
2. Added always-active development rule at `.agents/rules/context-and-change-control.md`.
3. Added reusable audit skill at `.agents/skills/nexova-milestone-audit/SKILL.md` with documented inputs and verifiable acceptance criteria.
