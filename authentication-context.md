# Securing the API: Authentication and Route Restriction in FastAPI


---

## 🎯 Your challenge


Your company's API is growing. You've built endpoints that serve data to the frontend, query the database, and process records — but right now, anyone who knows a URL can call any of them. Before the platform goes into its next phase, the CTO has made it clear: **no route that modifies or exposes sensitive data should be reachable without a valid session.**

Your tech lead has just dropped a ticket in your queue:

> #### AUTH-01 — Implement authentication and route protection
>
> The API currently has no authentication layer. This task covers:
>
> - A `users` module with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) for **credentials only** — email and password.
> - A `profiles` module with a one-to-one link to each user — **display name and contact data live on `Profile`, not on `User`.**
> - A login endpoint that validates credentials and returns a signed JWT token.
> - A reusable `get_current_user` dependency that decodes the token and identifies the caller.
> - Application of that dependency to all routes that should not be publicly accessible.
>
> Store `User` and `Profile` in **TinyDB only** — The JWT must carry the TinyDB user `id`; inventory and other modules reference it as `user_uuid`.
>
> Use `OAuth2PasswordBearer` from FastAPI and `python-jose` for token signing. Passwords must be hashed — never stored or compared in plain text. The token should carry the user's ID at minimum and expire after a configurable window.
>
> All auth-related routes must live under `/auth`. User management routes under `/users`. Profile routes under `/profiles`.

This is a security concern, not a feature: the work you do here protects everything that was built before it and everything that comes after. Do it right.

> **Note:** Once you protect your routes, some frontend calls may stop working temporarily — that's expected. The frontend will be updated to send the token in subsequent work. For now, focus on securing the API to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.

### Complementary knowledge: how JWT authentication works in FastAPI

If you haven't implemented JWT auth before, here's the mental model: when a user logs in, the server signs a small JSON payload (the "claims") using a secret key and returns the result as a token string. On subsequent requests, the client sends that token in the `Authorization` header. The server decodes it — if the signature is valid and the token hasn't expired, the request proceeds; if not, it gets a `401`.

In FastAPI, this flow is implemented as a dependency. You write a function that extracts the token from the request, validates it, and returns the user object. Any route that declares that function as a dependency will automatically require authentication.

## 🌱 How to Start the Project

This project is an extension of your existing transversal project API. **Do not create a new repository.** Work inside your company's current backend codebase.

1. Open your existing project in Codespaces or clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch for this feature: `git switch -c feature/auth-api`.
3. Install the required packages with `uv` (never use `pip install` or `pipenv`):
   ```bash
   uv add "python-jose[cryptography]" "libpass[bcrypt]"
   ```

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### User model and CRUD

- [ ] Create a `User` model in **TinyDB** with at least: `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `is_active`, `role`, `created_at`. Do **not** store display name or contact fields on `User`.
- [ ] The `role` field must accept only `admin`, `manager`, or `user`. Use an `Enum` or field validator to reject any other value. New registrations via `POST /users` default to `user`.
- [ ] Implement a service layer with functions for: create user, get user by ID, get user by email, update user, delete user.
- [ ] Expose those services as REST endpoints under `/users`:
  - `POST /users` — register a new user (hash the password before storing). Accept optional initial profile fields (`name`, `phone`, `address`) and create the linked `Profile` in the same operation.
  - `GET /users` — list all users (protected).
  - `GET /users/{id}` — get a single user (protected).
  - `PUT /users/{id}` — update credential fields such as `email`, and `role` when the caller is an `admin` (protected; only the user themselves or an admin).
  - `DELETE /users/{id}` — delete a user (protected). Also remove the linked profile.

### Profile model and endpoints

- [ ] Create a `Profile` model in **TinyDB**, linked one-to-one to `User` via `user_id`, with at least: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `phone`, `address`.
- [ ] Expose profile routes under `/profiles`:
  - `GET /profiles/me` (protected) — return the authenticated user's profile.
  - `PUT /profiles/me` (protected) — update `name`, `phone`, and `address`. Only the profile owner may update it.

### Authentication endpoints

- [ ] Implement `POST /auth/login` — accepts `email` and `password`, validates credentials, returns a JWT access token.
- [ ] Implement `GET /auth/me` (protected) — returns the authenticated user's `email`, `role`, plus the linked `Profile` (name and contact data).

### Token and dependency

- [ ] Create a `get_current_user` dependency that: extracts the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, decodes and validates the JWT, retrieves the user from the database, and raises `HTTPException(401)` if anything fails.
- [ ] Set token expiry via an environment variable (e.g. `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`). Store the signing secret in `.env` — never hardcode it.

### Route protection

- [ ] Apply `get_current_user` as a dependency to every route that should not be publicly accessible. At minimum: all `/users` endpoints except `POST /users`, `/auth/me`, **and at least 5 other existing routes** from your monorepo API (outside `/users` and `/auth`) that expose or modify sensitive data.
- [ ] Return `401 Unauthorized` for unauthenticated requests and `403 Forbidden` when a user tries to access a resource they don't own.

### Testing

- [ ] Verify the full flow manually using the FastAPI interactive docs (`/docs`): register via `POST /users` → login → copy token → use token on a protected route.
- [ ] Confirm that calling a protected route without a token returns `401`.
- [ ] Confirm that calling a protected route with an expired or malformed token returns `401`.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Store `User` and `Profile` in **TinyDB only** — now and after Supabase is added. Do not create user or profile tables in Supabase/SQLModel. Inventory and other PostgreSQL tables store only the TinyDB user `id` as `user_uuid`.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Do not use session-based or cookie-based authentication. This project implements stateless JWT auth only.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Never store plain-text passwords. Use `libpass` with the `bcrypt` scheme for all password operations. Install `libpass[bcrypt]` — not unmaintained `passlib`. The Python import stays `from passlib.hash import bcrypt` (libpass is a drop-in fork).

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] User CRUD is fully implemented and reachable via the API.
- [ ] Each `User` has a linked `Profile`; `name`, `phone`, and `address` are stored on `Profile`, not on `User`.
- [ ] The `role` field accepts only `admin`, `manager`, or `user`; new users created via `POST /users` default to `user`.
- [ ] Passwords are hashed at creation and compared correctly at login — plain text never touches the database.
- [ ] Login endpoint returns a valid, signed JWT token.
- [ ] `get_current_user` dependency correctly decodes the token and identifies the user.
- [ ] Protected routes return `401` when called without a valid token.
- [ ] A user accessing or updating another user's profile or credentials receives `403 Forbidden` (not only `401` for missing/invalid token).
- [ ] Token expiry and signing secret are read from environment variables, not hardcoded.
- [ ] Auth routes are under `/auth`, user routes under `/users`, and profile routes under `/profiles` — clean, consistent structure.
- [ ] At least **5 existing routes outside `/users` and `/auth`** require a valid token (in addition to the protected user/auth routes themselves).
- [ ] `User` and `Profile` remain in TinyDB after Supabase is introduced — no user tables in PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Protected monorepo routes still behave correctly when called with a valid token (no regressions).
