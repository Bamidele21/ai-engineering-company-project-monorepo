> #### AUTH-02 — Authentication flows and protected views in the frontend
>
> The API now requires a JWT token on protected routes. This task covers the frontend side of that contract:
>
> - **Login and registration views** — forms that call the API, receive the token, and store it correctly.
> - **Account management views** — profile page.
> - **Route protection** — any view that requires a session must redirect unauthenticated users to login. This applies to all applications in the monorepo **except the public website (Milestone 1)**, which remains fully public.
>
> The token must be stored in `localStorage` and attached to every protected API call via the `Authorization: Bearer` header. On logout, the token is removed and the user is redirected to login.
>
> Do not build a separate authentication app. Integrate these flows into the existing Next.js applications inside your monorepo.

### Complementary knowledge: the frontend side of JWT

Once the API returns a token at login, the frontend's job is: store it, send it, and react to its absence. The standard pattern in Next.js is:

1. **Store** the token in `localStorage` after a successful login response.
2. **Read** the token on every protected API call and set it in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`.
3. **Protect routes** — use a **client** layout guard or custom hook that reads `localStorage` and redirects to `/login` if the token is absent. Next.js middleware runs on the server and **cannot** read `localStorage`; do not use middleware for this check unless you also store a cookie the middleware can see.
4. **Clear** the token on logout and redirect.

> **Note:** The temporary frontend breakage from the previous delivery ends here. By the end of this project, all protected views should be working end-to-end with real authentication.

## 🌱 How to Start the Project

This project continues inside your existing monorepo. Work on the same branch or open a new one: `git switch -c feature/auth-frontend`.

Make sure your API from the previous delivery is running and reachable from the frontend before you start.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### Authentication views

- [ ] `/login` — email and password form. On success: store the token in `localStorage`, redirect to the main authenticated view. On failure: show a clear error message.
- [ ] `/register` — registration form. On success: call `POST /users` (include optional profile fields), then `POST /auth/login` with the same credentials, store the token, and redirect. On failure: show field-level validation errors.

### Account management views

- [ ] `/account/profile` — displays the current user's email plus profile data (`name`, `phone`, `address`) from `GET /auth/me`. Allows editing name and contact fields via `PUT /profiles/me` with the token in the header.

### Route protection

- [ ] Identify every view in your Next.js applications (excluding the public website) that requires an authenticated session.
- [ ] Implement a **client** protection mechanism (layout guard or custom hook) that checks for the token in `localStorage` and redirects to `/login` if it is absent or invalid. Do not use Next.js middleware for this unless the token is also in a cookie the middleware can read.
- [ ] Ensure the public website (Milestone 1) is entirely unaffected — no token check, no redirect.

### Token lifecycle

- [ ] On login and registration: store the token in `localStorage`.
- [ ] On every protected API call: read the token and attach it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- [ ] On logout: remove the token from `localStorage` and redirect to `/login`.
- [ ] If a protected API call returns `401`: clear the token and redirect to `/login`.

---

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] Login and registration forms work end-to-end: the token is stored after a successful call.
- [ ] Protected views redirect to `/login` when there is no valid token in storage.
- [ ] The public website (Milestone 1) continues to work without any authentication check.
- [ ] The profile view displays email from `User` and name/contact data from the linked `Profile`, and updates profile fields via `PUT /profiles/me`.
- [ ] Logout removes the token and redirects correctly.
- [ ] A `401` response from any protected API call clears the session and redirects to `/login`.
